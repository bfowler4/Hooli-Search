Why learn JavaScript?

JavaScript is the programming language of the web. It's one of the most popular and in demand skills in today's job market for good reason. JavaScript not only enables you to add powerful interactions to websites, but is also the foundation of a lot of commonly used libraries (like jQuery) and frameworks (like AngularJS, ReactJS and NodeJS). As a web developer, it is essential that you have a solid understanding of this versatile language.
