/r/programming is a reddit for discussion and news about computer programming

Guidelines

    Please try to keep submissions on topic and of high quality.
    Just because it has a computer in it doesn't make it programming.
    Memes and image macros are not acceptable forms of content.
    If there is no code in your link, it probably doesn't belong here.
    App demos should include code and/or architecture discussion.
    Please follow proper reddiquette.

Info

    Do you have a question? Check out /r/learnprogramming, /r/cscareerquestions, or Stack Overflow.
    Do you have something funny to share with fellow programmers? Please take it to /r/ProgrammerHumor/.
    For posting job listings, please visit /r/forhire or /r/jobbit.
    Check out our faq. It could use some updating.
    If you're an all-star hacker (or even just beginning), why not join the discussion at /r/redditdev and steal our reddit code!
