Programming, Motherfucker
Do you speak it?

We are a community of motherfucking programmers who have been humiliated by software development methodologies for years.

We are tired of XP, Scrum, Kanban, Waterfall, Software Craftsmanship (aka XP-Lite) and anything else getting in the way of...Programming, Motherfucker.

We are tired of being told we're socialy awkward idiots who need to be manipulated to work in a Forced Pair Programming chain gang without any time to be creative because none of the 10 managers on the project can do... Programming, Motherfucker.

We must destroy these methodologies that get in the way of...Programming, Motherfucker.

Our Values
They Claim To Value	They Really Value	We Fucking Do
Individuals and interactions	Tons of billable hours	Programming, Motherfucker
Working software	Tons of pointless tests	Programming, Motherfucker
Customer collaboration	Bleeding clients dry	Programming, Motherfucker
Responding to change	Instability and plausible deniability	Programming, Motherfucker

We think the shit on the left, is really just the con in the middle, and that we really need to just do the thing on the right...Programming, Motherfucker.
